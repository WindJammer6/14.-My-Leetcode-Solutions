# Competitive Programming 4 Solutions
My solutions to some of the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) problems listed in [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4).
Some [UVA Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) problems are also solved on [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/).

The C++ code is written to be compiled using with gcc version 11.2.0 (Ubuntu 11.2.0-19ubuntu1)
<pre>g++ -std=c++17 kattis_xxx.cpp -o kattis_xxx && kattis_xxx</pre>

Python code is executed using Python 3.10.4 on my machine but will work on the 3.6 of Kattis
<pre>/bin/python3 kattis_xxx.py</pre>
