# 14.-My-Leetcode-Solutions :dart:
Here are some of my accepted attempts at some Leetcode questions. And hey, I managed to learn how to automate the process of updating my README.md file whenever I solved and 
upload a new solution to a Leetcode question in this repository!

My Leetcode account: https://leetcode.com/WindJammer6/

<ins>Disclaimer</ins>: I am a student programmer, these solutions that I have attached in this repository are not perfect answers to the Leetcode questions (in terms of design 
and Time and Space Big O Notation Complexity), but are just merely my sharing of my own approach to the questions (in terms of design and Time and Space Big O Notation Complexity).
They do answer the Leetcode questions, but there are definitely better answer codes out there.
