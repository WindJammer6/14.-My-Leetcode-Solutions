# The Union Find Algorithm has 2 important operations/functions,
# 1. Find:
# The task is to find representative of the set of a given element. The representative is always root 
# of the tree. So we implement find() by recursively traversing the parent array until we hit a node 
# that is root (parent of itself).

# 2. Union: 
# The task is to combine two sets and make one. It takes two elements as input and finds the 
# representatives of their sets using the Find operation, and finally puts either one of the trees 
# (representing the set) under the root node of the other tree.


# Using the code implementation of Union Find Algorithm from GeekforGeeks

        # element as its own representative

        # Else recursively find the representative 
        # of the parent
